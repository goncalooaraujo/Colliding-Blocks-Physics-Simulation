# Colliding Blocks Physics Simulation

A Python simulation that visualizes the calculation of $\pi$ through the elastic collisions of two sliding blocks. Based on the mathematical discovery by Gregory Galperin, this project demonstrates how a massive block ($100^N$ kg) colliding with a smaller block (1 kg) against a rigid wall generates a precise number of collisions corresponding to the digits of Pi. It features a custom event-driven physics engine to ensure 100% accuracy, preventing "tunneling" even at extreme velocities.
